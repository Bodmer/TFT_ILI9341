This is a standalone library that contains both graphics functions
and the TFT ILI9341 driver library.

This library has been derived from the Adafruit_GFX and driver library with
further code from other authors.

It is not compatible with legacy versions of the IDE (e.g. 1.0.6 and
older. Use the latest 1.6.x version.

New functions have been added in particular it contains proportional fonts
in addition to the original Adafruit font.

Note: This version of the library might not be fully compatible with the original.


===============================================================
Hereafter is the original README text for the Adafruit library:
===============================================================

This is the core graphics library for all our displays, providing
a common set of graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, etc.).

It needs to be paired with a hardware-specific library for each
display device we carry (to handle the lower-level functions).

Adafruit invests time and resources providing this open source
code, please support Adafruit and open-source hardware by
purchasing products from Adafruit!
